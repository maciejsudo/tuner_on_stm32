# tuner_on_stm32

This project is made for developing and exploring basic DSP algorithms on ARM Cortex M7.   

Project mainly concentrates on fundamental frequency estimation algorithm based on FFT and IFFT ARM functions. In this project TouchGFX Designer was used to create graphical user interface - as photograph below shows, it allows to watch realtime spectrum visualisation, and estimated fundamental frequency of guitar string. It also got listed 6 strings typical frequency values used for Stadard E tunning (photo below shows all needed values).

Photo above shows proper estimation of E4 string frequency(~329.6Hz)
